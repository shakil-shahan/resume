My journey began with 4+ years of dedicated work in Node.js, where I honed my skills in  Express, NestJS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and more.\n \nCurrently, my focus has expanded to include Golang, Python, and harnessing AWS services, alongside my continued expertise in Node.js. This shift underscores my commitment to staying at the forefront of technology trends. I am proficient in Git and have learned a versatile array of tools and technologies such as Restify, Ionic, Angular, Socket, Firebase, Swagger, PostgreSQL, Azure, Docker, PM2, and many more during my development journey.\n \nMy approach to challenges is methodical, I believe in understanding the 'why' of a problem before determining the 'how,'. I invest time in conceptualizing and sketching solutions, with a strong emphasis on creating highly readable and easily maintainable source code.\n \nWith a detail-oriented mindset and successful team management experience, I am constantly striving to learn new technologies, team and task management, and ways to better myself in this rapidly evolving industry.",

Before my time, the team have had the responsibilities of developing the entire backend system, along with a frontend portal and a user app. As of this writing, the company is at the end of the startup phase, and about to officially start selling our product. My recommendation is over the past year, where I have been Shakil’s Tech Lead and Co-Developer, but it is worth mentioning that there is an impressive amount of work that has been done before my time. SensCom have over the past year invested in new personnel, and our IT team have for the most part worked on revamping our entire system for scalability, new and improved user experience for our app and web portal, and of course a lot of new functionalities.\n\nDuring my time, Shakil have spent most of the time in the frontend portal. The portal is made with Angular and connects to Azure AD for authentication and our REST API to load all other data. For a long time, Shakil was our only developer in the web frontend, and thus deserves the honour for a lot of the functionality that is there today. Today, the frontend team has expanded to 4. Kudos to Shakil for being able to maintain a coding style which have made it easy and fast to onboard new team members.\n\nAs a Tech Lead, I am loving to work with developers like Shakil. There is not much explanations needed when assigning new tasks as he have taken the responsibilities of learning and understanding the system we work in. Before committing his code, he is also summarizing and displaying his work to ensure the end result is as expected. From a Tech Lead’s perspective, it is very reassuring to write and assign new tasks without having to worry. Working with someone you have big trust in may cause the Tech Lead’s task descriptions to occasionally be sloppy or even cause problems if developed, and then its extra reassuring to know that Shakil will initiate a discussion before proceeding. When Shakil is out of assignments, he will announce so and suggest things he can do while waiting for new tasks.\n\nAs a Co-Developer, Shakil have made much of the backend code visible in the frontend portal. It is very easy to work with Shakil, and even though it usually makes more sense to request displaying existing backend logic in frontend, it is no problem to communicate what will be developed before it exists. Shakil is a great team player, and I have great fun teaming up and making new functionalities. \n\nIt is my honour to work with Shakil and grant him my recommendation. Shakil is an amazing developer that keeps on delivering, and he got all the qualities that a trustable developer should have. To whoever reads this in the future, this is a person you would definitely want in your team 😊"

I not only discovered that he is a professional and an extraordinary engineer, with an enormous talent for the development and creation of technology, but also an exceptional, hard-working, proactive and loyal person, maximum with the team. Shakil becomes by right one of the fundamental pieces of all the projects in which he participates. It puts forward, knowledge, enthusiasm, eagerness to learn, initiative, talent, and in short, all those things that we responsible ask when we look for a person for our team and that we rarely find. In my case, I had the luck and honor to work with Shakil and I can say that he is one of the professionals that I will always remember and one of the young technical referents I will always remember of certain projects that are extraordinarily powerful and ambitious. A huge potential that I'm sure will develop 1000% in the coming years."
